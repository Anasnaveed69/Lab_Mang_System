## 2. CK Metrics (Chidamber and Kemerer Object-Oriented Design Metrics)

**YES, CK METRICS ARE PRESENT** in the CCCC report. The following CK metrics are included:

### CK Metrics Overview

The CCCC tool reports **4 out of 6** standard CK metrics:

1. **WMC (Weighted Methods per Class)** - ✅ Present
2. **DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree)** - ✅ Present
3. **NOC (Number of Children)** - ✅ Present
4. **CBO (Coupling Between Objects)** - ✅ Present
5. **RFC (Response For a Class)** - ❌ Not reported
6. **LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods)** - ❌ Not reported

### CK Metrics by Module

| Module Name | WMC1 | WMCv | DIT | NOC | CBO |
|-------------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|
| **AcademicOfficerUI** | 14 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **AttendantUI** | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

| **LabSession** | 15 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| **MainMenu** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **MakeupRequest** | 20 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| **Room** | 13 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| **Section** | 20 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 6 |

| **Timing** | 15 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| **anonymous** | 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### CK Metrics Analysis

#### WMC (Weighted Methods per Class)
- **WMC1**: Total number of methods per class
- **WMCv**: Number of visible (public) methods per class
- **Range**: 1 (MainMenu) to 24 (StorageManager)
- **Average WMC1**: ~11.3 methods per class
- **Concern**: StorageManager has the highest WMC (24), indicating it may be doing too much (potential violation of Single Responsibility Principle)

#### DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree)
- **All modules**: DIT = 0
- **Interpretation**: No inheritance hierarchy exists in the codebase
- **Impact**: No code reuse through inheritance, but also no inheritance-related complexity

#### NOC (Number of Children)
- **All modules**: NOC = 0
- **Interpretation**: No classes are being extended/inherited
- **Impact**: Confirms flat class structure with no polymorphism through inheritance

#### CBO (Coupling Between Objects)
- **Range**: 0 to 8
- **Average**: ~2.8
- **High CBO modules**:
  - StorageManager: 8 (highest coupling)
  - LabSession: 7
  - MakeupRequest: 6
  - Section: 6
- **Interpretation**: Moderate coupling overall. StorageManager shows high coupling, which is expected for a manager class but should be monitored.

### Complexity Analysis

**Highest Complexity Modules:**
1. **StorageManager**: 88 (28% of total complexity)
2. **AcademicOfficerUI**: 39 (12% of total complexity)
3. **AttendantUI**: 28 (9% of total complexity)
4. **HeadOfDepartmentUI**: 29 (9% of total complexity)
5. **InputUtil**: 31 (10% of total complexity)

**Recommendations:**
- StorageManager should be refactored to reduce complexity
- UI classes (AcademicOfficerUI, AttendantUI, HeadOfDepartmentUI) show high complexity - consider breaking down into smaller methods
- InputUtil has high complexity relative to its size (31 complexity in 85 LOC)

## 4. Structural Metrics Summary

### Fan-In and Fan-Out Analysis

**High Fan-In Modules** (many modules depend on these):
- StorageManager: Fan-in = 8 (visible)
- LabSession: Fan-in = 5-6
- MakeupRequest: Fan-in = 5
- Section: Fan-in = 4-5
- Building, Instructor, Room, TA: Fan-in = 4

**High Fan-Out Modules** (depend on many modules):
- string: Fan-out = 11 (visible)
- ifstream, ofstream, ostream: Fan-out = 8 (visible)
- Most application modules have low fan-out (0-1)

### Information Flow (IF4) Metrics

**Highest IF4 Values:**
- LabSession: IF4 = 36
- Section: IF4 = 25
- MakeupRequest: IF4 = 25
- Building, Instructor, Room, TA: IF4 = 16

**Interpretation**: Higher IF4 values indicate higher structural complexity and coupling. LabSession shows the highest information flow complexity.

## 5. Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Moderate overall complexity**: Average cyclomatic complexity per module is reasonable (13.870)
2. **Low inheritance complexity**: DIT = 0 for all classes (no deep inheritance hierarchies)
3. **Reasonable module size**: Average LOC per module is 84.957, which is manageable

### Critical Issues
1. **Zero comments**: No documentation in the codebase - CRITICAL for maintainability
2. **High complexity in key modules**: StorageManager (88), AcademicOfficerUI (39), InputUtil (31)
3. **High coupling**: StorageManager has CBO = 8, indicating tight coupling

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Add comments**: Implement comprehensive documentation for all classes and methods
2. **Refactor StorageManager**: Break down into smaller, more focused classes
3. **Reduce UI complexity**: Simplify AcademicOfficerUI, AttendantUI, and HeadOfDepartmentUI

#### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Reduce coupling**: Consider dependency injection or facade patterns for StorageManager
2. **Extract methods**: Break down high-complexity methods in InputUtil
3. **Code review**: Focus on modules with complexity > 20

#### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Consider inheritance**: While current flat structure is simple, strategic use of inheritance could improve code reuse
2. **Implement design patterns**: Consider patterns to reduce coupling and improve maintainability
3. **Establish coding standards**: Define complexity thresholds and enforce through code reviews

## 6. Module-Specific Recommendations

### StorageManager (Highest Priority)
- **Issues**: LOC=374, MVG=88, CBO=8, WMC=24
- **Actions**: 
  - Split into multiple smaller classes (e.g., FileManager, DataManager)
  - Extract complex methods
  - Reduce dependencies

### AcademicOfficerUI
- **Issues**: LOC=204, MVG=39
- **Actions**: 
  - Break down into smaller UI components
  - Extract validation logic
  - Simplify control flow

### InputUtil
- **Issues**: MVG=31 in only 85 LOC (high complexity density)
- **Actions**: 
  - Extract validation methods
  - Use state machine or strategy pattern for complex input handling

### LabSession
- **Issues**: IF4=36 (highest information flow)
- **Actions**: 
  - Review dependencies
  - Consider if responsibilities can be separated

## Conclusion

The codebase shows **moderate overall quality** with several areas requiring attention. The **CK metrics are present and properly reported** by CCCC, providing valuable insights into the object-oriented design quality. The most critical issue is the complete absence of comments, which significantly impacts maintainability. High complexity in key modules (StorageManager, UI classes) and coupling concerns should be addressed through refactoring.

**Overall Grade: C+** (Moderate quality with critical documentation issues)
